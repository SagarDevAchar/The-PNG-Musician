# The PNG Musician

An LSB2 Steganography Decoder which extracts and plays MP3 Audio from the PNG Images generated by [**The MP3 Photographer**](https://github.com/SagarDevAchar/TheMP3Photographer)

## About the project

This is third part of the **Steganography Made Fun!** toolkit

The toolkit has three parts divided into three repositories:

- Part 1: [The TXT Hider](https://sagardevachar.github.io/TheTXTHider/)
- Part 2: [The MP3 Photographer](https://sagardevachar.github.io/TheMP3Photographer/)
- Part 3: [The PNG Musician](https://sagardevachar.github.io/ThePNGMusician/) (This Repository)

## Repository Structure

- `bin\` : Contains the `mpg123` binary for Audio Playback
- `SRC\` : Contains the Steganographically Encoded PNG Files
- `LICENSE` : GNU GPL v3.0 License for [The PNG Musician](https://github.com/SagarDevAchar/ThePNGMusician)
- `README.md` : Here you are!
- `install_requirements.bat` : Installs the necessary package requirements using `pip` (Requires `pip` access in `PATH`)
- `The PNG Musician.py` : Source Code

## Usage Instructions

1. Just let things be where they are (relatively)
1. Run `The PNG Musician.py` using the IDE of your choice or via CMD using the `python "The PNG Musician.py"` command
1. Witness the magic (well, not really :P)

Place the Custom PNG files generated by [**The MP3 Photographer**](https://github.com/SagarDevAchar/TheMP3Photographer) in the `SRC\` folder to play it in [**The PNG Musician**](https://github.com/SagarDevAchar/ThePNGMusician)

## Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows
- **Python Version:** 3.5+
- **Packages:** [TQDM](https://tqdm.github.io/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)

You can install the requirements by running the `install_requirements.bat`. You can always create a virtual environment to prevent your version critical installations from being modified (You need to switch to the virtual environment before running the batch file)
